    <title>Cache Groups</title>
     <para>
      You can do more elaborate grouping by setting up cache_id groups. This is
      accomplished by separating each sub-group with a vertical bar "|" in the
      cache_id value. You can have as many sub-groups as you like.

     <example>
      <title>cache_id groups</title>
      <programlisting role="php">
<![CDATA[
<?php
require('Smarty.class.php');
$smarty = new Smarty;

$smarty->caching = true;

// clear all caches with "sports|basketball" as the first two cache_id groups
$smarty->clear_cache(null,"sports|basketball");

// clear all caches with "sports" as the first cache_id group. This would
// include "sports|basketball", or "sports|(anything)|(anything)|(anything)|..."
$smarty->clear_cache(null,"sports");

$smarty->display('index.tpl',"sports|basketball");

       The cache grouping does NOT use the path to the template as any part of the
       cache_id. For example, if you have display('themes/blue/index.tpl'), you
       cannot clear the cache for everything under the "themes/blue" directory. If
       you want to do that, you must group them in the cache_id, such as
       display('themes/blue/index.tpl','themes|blue'); Then you can clear the
       caches for the blue theme with clear_cache(null,'themes|blue');
