Smarty 3.2 Notes
================

Enhancements
------------

    $cache_modified_check
Befor 3.2 the brower cache was not used with cached subtemplates which did have individual cache_lifetime.
Smarty 3.2 does now also check the update time of each cached subtemplate. 


Default settings
----------------

    $merge_compiled_include
For maximum redering speed this option is enabled now by default.
Because of this you will no longer see compiled template files in $compile_dir as the compiled code
is merged into the compiled main templates.


Deprecated functionality
------------------------

    registered objects
The use of registered objects has been deprecated and is removed from standard Smarty.
For backward compatibility it is available by the SmartyBC class.


New template features
---------------------

    whitespace control
Whitespaces in front or after tags can now be controled by the tag itself.
{-tag} remove white space infront of tag up to the previous non-whitespace character or beginning of the line
   "text \n\n\t {-tag}" -> "text \n\n{tag}"
   "text \n\n\t text\t {-tag}" -> "text \n\n\t text{tag}"
{--tag} remove white space infront of tag up to the previous non-whitespace character
   "text \n\n\t {--tag}" -> "text{tag}"
   "text \n\n\t text\t {--tag}" -> "text \n\n\t text{tag}"
{tag-} remove white space after tag up to the next non-whitespace character or end of the line
   "{tag-} \n\n\t text" -> "{tag}\n\n\t text"
   "{tag-} text \n\n\t text" -> "{tag}text \n\n\t text"
{tag--} remove white space after tag up to the next non-whitespace character
   "{tag--} \n\n\t text" -> "{tag}text"
   "{tag--} text \n\n\t text" -> "{tag}text \n\n\t text"
