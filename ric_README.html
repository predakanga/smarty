Smarty 3.0 Alpha 1 : Proof of Concept

Author: Monte Ohrt &lt;monte at ohrt dot com &gt;

This code is a proof of concept as a basis of the Smarty 3 template engine.
It is by no means complete, it is only a shell of an infrastructure to build
the 3.0 codebase upon. What I need is feedback before continuing! Now is the
time to make decisions that will affect the engine fundamentals.

So, a quick intro to the thinking behind this alpha code.

If you take a look at the file structure, you should see this:

index.php
/libs/
  Smarty.class.php
/libs/sysplugins/
  internal.*
/plugins/
  function.mailto.php
  modifier.escape.php
/templates/
  index.tpl
  index_view.php
  

If you execute the index.php file, you will see an example of using Smarty to
display a couple of template files.

The way to use Smarty 3 should look extremely familiar:

require('Smarty.class.php');
$smarty = new Smarty;
$smarty-&gt;assign('foo','bar');
$smarty-&gt;display('index.tpl');


However, Smarty works completely different on the inside. The majority of
the Smarty system now lies in the plugin directory. The core Smarty.class.php
class is extremely slim. The fundamental idea is for Smarty to lazy-load all
requirements (objects) on an as-needed basis.

LEXER!

Smarty 3 now uses a real lexing tokenizer. This opens all kinds of doors
such as template math, function recursion, among many other things.

$smarty OBJECT SINGLETON

Do you need a reference to the Smarty object instance? No problem:

$smarty = Smarty::instance();

You can do this from anywhere in your PHP code, and get the instance. You can
be buried in a php function, in a class method, or wherever. The $smarty
object is quickly obtainable.

Since all plugins are now classes (did I mention that yet?), They all extend
Smarty_Internal_PluginBase, which makes $this-&gt;smarty a reference to the Smarty
object instance. This is available to all plugins.

PHP TEMPLATES

Smarty's fundamental design goals are meant to separate business logic from
presentation logic. Since Smarty 2.0 templates work on a tag-based syntax, this
has usually equated to &quot;Don't put PHP in the templates.&quot; But, these two
philosophies are completely separate. You could conceivably use plain PHP
scripts as your templates and still maintain business logic separation.
Even though PHP is used in the template, it is still just presentation logic.

So now you have your choice: Use templates that are just plain PHP code, or
use the compiled templates using the familiar {$foo} tag syntax. Whatever is
more important to you (PHP or tags/security/etc), make your own choice. Just
remember, PHP templates require YOU to keep the separation yourself. It won't
be as obvious.

If you want to use a PHP template, just use the &quot;php&quot; resource type:

$smarty-&gt;display('php:mytemplate.tpl');

Smarty will not compile it, it will just get executed as PHP. You have full
reign of PHP in your template code. Your assigned template vars are available
simply as &lt;?=$foo?&gt; &lt;?=$bar?&gt;, etc.

You can also use strings as templates with the &quot;string&quot; resource type:

$smarty-&gt;display('string:This is my template, {$foo}!');

ACCESSING PLUGINS (modifiers, functions)

We haven't landed on a syntax for accessing plugins from PHP templates.
It needs to be simple, yet robust. Some ideas:

// load/run modifier in-template
$this-&gt;modifier('truncate',$foo,$args);

// load modifier into php function first
$smarty-&gt;load-&gt;modifier('truncate','truncate');
// execute in template;
truncate($foo,$args);


Many other things are on the list, such as:

* cache file resources
* compile file resources
* config file resources
* template objects
* per template caching
* per function caching
* per variable caching


Ok that pretty much wraps up the principles behind the alpha code. Please
look through it and send any questions/suggestions/etc to the forums.
