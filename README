This directory contains the documentation for Smarty. All files are in docbook
format with an .sgml extention. The top level directory contains the english
docs, while the subdirs contain different available languages.

To compile the documentation, I use the docbook utilities (available as an rpm
for redhat linux.) Compiling goes as such:

cd docs
db2html -d /path/to/html.dsl manual.sgml

Be sure to edit the html.dsl file and set the path to your docbook.dsl
stylesheet file.

This will create a subdirectory called manual/ which will contain the generated
HTML docs to view with a browser.
