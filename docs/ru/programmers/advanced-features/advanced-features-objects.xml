    <title>Objects</title>
    <para>
     Smarty allows access to PHP objects through the templates. There are
	 two ways to access them. One way is to register objects to the template,
	 then use access them via syntax similar to custom functions. The other way
	 is to assign objects to the templates and access them much like any other
	 assigned variable. The first method has a much nicer template syntax. It
	 is also more secure, as a registered object can be restricted to certain
	 methods or properties. However, a registered object cannot be looped over
	 or assigned in arrays of objects, etc. The method you choose will be
	 determined by your needs, but use the first method whenever possible to
	 keep template syntax to a minimum.
    </para>
	<para>
    If security is enabled, no private methods or functions can be accessed
	(begininning with "_"). If a method and property of the same name exist,
	the method will be used.
	</para>
	<para>
	You can restrict the methods and properties that can be accessed by
	listing them in an array as the third registration parameter.
	</para>
	<para>
	By default, parameters passed to objects through the templates are passed
	the same way custom functions get them. An associative array is passed
	as the first parameter, and the smarty object as the second. If you want
	the parameters passed one at a time for each argument like traditional
	object parameter passing, set the fourth registration parameter to false.

     <title>using a registered or assigned object</title>
     <programlisting role="php">
<![CDATA[
<?php
// the object

class My_Object() {
	function meth1($params, &$smarty_obj) {
		return "this is my meth1";
	}
}

$myobj = new My_Object;
// registering the object (will be by reference)
$smarty->register_object("foobar",$myobj);
// if we want to restrict access to certain methods or properties, list them
$smarty->register_object("foobar",$myobj,array('meth1','meth2','prop1'));
// if you want to use the traditional object parameter format, pass a boolean of false
$smarty->register_object("foobar",$myobj,null,false);

// We can also assign objects. Assign by ref when possible.
$smarty->assign_by_ref("myobj", $myobj);

$smarty->display("index.tpl");
?>

TEMPLATE:

{* access our registered object *}
{foobar->meth1 p1="foo" p2=$bar}

{* you can also assign the output *}
{foobar->meth1 p1="foo" p2=$bar assign="output"}
the output was {$output)

{* access our assigned object *}
{$myobj->meth1("foo",$bar)}
